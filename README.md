# Process Design of 50T/a Brexpiprazole Intermediate (4-chlorobenzo[b]thiophene) Workshop

## Abstract:
Schizophrenia and depression are a kind of mental illness, which can cause great damage to human physiology and psychology. The most commonly used antipsychotics are neuroleptics. Brexpiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic. By activating the activity of 5-HTlA receptors of serotonin and partial agonists of dopamine D2 receptors, brexpiprazole reaches good effective in the treatment of schizophrenia and major depression. Brexpiprazole has multi-target antipsychotic properties, therefore lower drug tolerance and adverse reactions, so it has a broad market and application prospects.
This assay discusses the recent status of the synthesis of the important intermediates. From the perspective of economy and environmental protection, a route is selected for the industrial production of 4-chlorobenzo[b]thiophene which is an important intermediate of brexpiprazole. Finally, the process design of workshop are provided.
